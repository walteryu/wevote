### Introduction

This repository contains the initial WeVote project which was developed at [Startup Weekend Sacramento](http://communities.techstars.com/usa/sacramento/startup-weekend/14400) in June 2019. The project prevents project delays and lawsuits during the public comment period.

### Objectives

The project objectives are as follows:

1. Reduce project risk by minimizing project delays and lawsuits
2. Allow constituents to vote on projects and initiatives
3. Allow project owners to track voting and sentiment

### Methodology

This project was developed based on coach feedback and custom development during the event; it pivoted into this concept for the following reasons:

1. Customers have a pain point with costly project delays and lawsuits
2. Constituents may not be involved with the civic engagement process
3. Project owners are required by law to hold public comment periods
4. Project satisfies multiple portions of the sustainability model
