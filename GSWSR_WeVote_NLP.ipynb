    "\n",
    "Data cleaning was completed prior to analysis; as a result, the datasets were cleaned to minimize the impact of outlier, missing or repeated values as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replaced empty and missing values since they may cause errors during analysis.\n",
    "2. Removed negative values since they may skew summary statistics and results.\n",
    "3. Removed outlier values by removing values greater or less than 3 standard deviations from the mean since they will skew results. Specifically, outlier values will skew summary statistics such as the mean, median and standard deviation.\n",

    "After data cleaning, the household, trip and vehicle tables were sorted by census district to begin the analysis."
