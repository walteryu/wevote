### Dataset, Import and Analysis

The dataset is composed of seed data used for the project dashboard and consists of project info, vote (yes/no) and comments. Data import and analysis steps were as follows:

1. Import data from CSV file as a Pandas dataframe
2. Iterate through the comment text column and analyze text
3. Output sentiment scores (proof-of-concept)

### Next Steps

This notebook is an initial concept, so next steps are as follows:

1. Aggregate real data from the platform
2. Analyze punctuation and other grammar features
3. Incorporate into formal machine learning workflow
